            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page by using tags and attributes. Tags are used to define the different
            elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Attributes are used to provide
            additional information about the elements, such as their size, color, and style.</p>

        <p>
            Semantic HTML is a type of HTML code that uses tags to describe the meaning of the content on a web page.
            This is in contrast to non-semantic HTML, which uses tags to describe how the content should be displayed.
            Semantic HTML is important for a number of reasons. First, it helps to make web pages more accessible to
            people with disabilities. Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can use semantic HTML to
            understand the meaning of the content on a page, and to provide a better user experience for people with
            disabilities.
